title: Installing Anaconda along with ROS
---

In this blog post, I am going to explain the steps required for installing [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) along with [ROS](http://www.ros.org/). More specifically, I am going to use following environment-

* [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo)
* [Anaconda](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/) 64 Bit

Important
---------
Before we install `anaconda`, we need to check the default python of the system. Open terminal or press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> and use the following command-
```
python --version
```
In my system, the default python is `2.7.6`. Hence, I am going to install `anaconda` corresponding to python 2.7. **Note that anaconda installation process mentioned below is same irrespective of python version. However, you need to download the correct anaconda version depending on python version.**

Anaconda Installer File
-----------------------
Depending on the python version, download the `anaconda` installer file as listed below-
* [For Python 2.7 version](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda2-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh)
* [For Python 3.6 version](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh)

*In this blog post, I am going to assume that the default python version is 2.7 (ROS Indigo works on Python 2.7).*

Setup
-----
Below are the installation steps for anaconda [1]. 

* Please open terminal or press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> and use the following command-
```
mkdir ~/tools
cd ~/tools
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda2-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Generally, I keep all the tools inside `tools` subdirectory under `$HOME`. However, it is not mandatory. We have downloaded anaconda installer using `wget` tool. Skip this step if you already have anaconda installer file.

* Install anaconda using the following command-
```
bash Anaconda2-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p anaconda
```
* Optionally, you are free to delete or move the installer file as per your preference.
* Make `conda` visible by adding `conda` command to `$PATH`. Open `~/.bashrc` file by using `gedit ~/.bashrc` and append the following text-
```
# Permanently enabling the 'conda' command
# BUT NOT putting conda's base (root) environment on PATH
. /home/ravi/tools/anaconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
```
*Please note that the above command allows ROS to work with anaconda.* Please DO NOT add conda directly to `$PATH` since it breaks ROS. In other words, DO NOT append the following text to `~/.bashrc`-
```
export PATH="~/tools/anaconda/bin:$PATH"
```
Close the terminal.

Setup Verification
------------------
In order to verify our conda installation, let's create an environment named `testenv` for python 3.6. First, open a new terminal or press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> then use the following command-
```
conda create -n testenv python=3.6
```
* Now check the conda version by using the following command-
```
ravi@lab:~$ conda --version
conda 4.5.4
```
* Similarly, check the default python version.
```
ravi@lab:~$ python --version
Python 2.7.6
```
* Activate `testenv` environment using the following command-
```
conda activate testenv
```
* Now verify the python version inside this environment. We should expect to see python 3.6. Let see-
```
(testenv) ravi@lab:~$ python --version
Python 3.6.5 :: Anaconda, Inc.
```

Hurray! We have installed anaconda without breaking ROS.
