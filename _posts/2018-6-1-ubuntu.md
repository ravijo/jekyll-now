title: How to fix broken package error in Ubuntu
---

I am a great fan of Ubuntu am I am using it since [Hardy Heron](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardyHeron) (Ubuntu 8.04 LTS). Presently, I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS majorly because of [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo) support. 

Recently, some of ROS packages got removed due to a silly mistake. In order to install these packages again, I removed complete ROS using following command-
```
sudo apt-get remove ros-*
```

Note that the above command is a bit risky and it should be the following
```
sudo apt-get purge '^ros-*'
```
The above command match only things that start with `ros-`, otherwise it will uninstall other packages that contain the string `ros`, like things with `microsoft` [1].

I installed ROS using `sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full` so I think an easier way of uninstalling ROS should be the following-
```
ravi@lab:~$ sudo apt-get remove ros-indigo-desktop-full
ravi@lab:~$ sudo apt-get purge ros-indigo-desktop-full
ravi@lab:~$ sudo apt-get autoremove
```

Anyway, I tried to install ROS again and encountered `broken packages` error.
```
ravi@lab:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-indigo-desktop-full : Depends: ros-indigo-perception but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```

After, I tried possible solutions but failed.
```

**In this blog post, I am going to explain how to fix broken package error.** _Note that the easiest way to solve this problem is re-installation of Ubuntu but that's not the way, I want to._

Let's look into the problem once more. The `ros-indigo-desktop-full` package depends on `ros-indigo-perception`. Hence, in order to install `ros-indigo-desktop-full` package, `apt-get` is going to install `ros-indigo-perception`. However, due to broken packages, this package can't be installed.
 
So, let's try to install `ros-indigo-perception` manually-
```
ravi@lab:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-perception

 ros-indigo-perception : Depends: ros-indigo-perception-pcl but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```
Oops! It didn't work. Let's try more-
```
ravi@lab:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-perception-pcl

E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```

No luck but don't give up so early. Try more-
```
ravi@lab:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-pcl-conversions

We are able to find out the package dependencies. I dug more and realized that the problem is occurring due to `libusb-1.0-0`. So let's remove it-
```
sudo apt-get remove libusb-1.0-0
```
_Note that `libusb` is a USB programming library that gives easy access to USB devices. Hence, while removing `libusb`, we might have removed many other critical libraries. So let's fix these issues before powering off the machine._

First, let's install ROS again (that's what I was trying to do)-
```
sudo apt install ros-indigo-desktop-full
sudo apt-get install -f
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall
mkdir -p ~/ros_ws/src
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
cd ros_ws/
catkin_make
catkin_make install
sudo apt-get install git-core python-argparse python-wstool python-vcstools python-rosdep ros-indigo-control-msgs ros-indigo-joystick-drivers
```
At this point, I still suspect that we haven't recovered entirely but I think, we should be okay to go. It is the time to reboot the OS.

After rebooting, the login doesn't work, and it says `Failed to start session`. Don't panic, while staying at the login screen press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>. It will take to the terminal. Use the credentials to login. Finally, restore the desktop using the following command [2]-
```
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
```
Hurray! We fixed it. We have ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS without `broken package` error.
