title: Use PCL 1.8
---

In this post, we are going to learn how to use PCL 1.8. Let's start with installation.

### Steps to install PCL 1.8 locally
1. Clone the source from Git using following command `git clone https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl.git`
2. Go inside the downloaded source i.e., `cd pcl`
3. Make directory to build cmake files i.e., `mkdir build`
4. Go inside the directory i.e., `cd build`
5. Create additional directory to store compiled files i.e., `mkdir ../release`
6. Run cmake by providing recently created `release` directory as `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` i.e., 
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=None -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`pwd`/../release -DBUILD_GPU=ON -DBUILD_apps=ON -DBUILD_examples=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`pwd`/../release .. 
```
7. Run make i.e., `make`
8. Run make install i.e., `make install`

Please remember the full path to `release` directory. In my computer, it is `/home/ravi/Tools/pcl/release`.


### Configure CMakeLists.txt to Use PCL 1.8
Make sure to set following variables in your `CMakeLists.txt` file
```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6 FATAL_ERROR)

set(PCL_FOLDER /home/ravi/Tools/pcl/release)
find_package(PCL 1.8 REQUIRED PATHS ${PCL_FOLDER} NO_DEFAULT_PATH)

include_directories(${PCL_INCLUDE_DIRS})
link_directories(${PCL_LIBRARY_DIRS})
add_definitions(${PCL_DEFINITIONS})

MESSAGE(STATUS "PCL_VERSION: " ${PCL_VERSION})

add_executable (simple_visualizer src/simple_visualizer.cpp)
target_link_libraries (simple_visualizer ${PCL_LIBRARIES})
```
