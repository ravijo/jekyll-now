I am working as a senior robotics engineer in [TechMagic (a Japanese venture to create a sustainable food industry using robotics)](https://techmagic.co.jp/). I received Ph.D. degree from the [Kyushu Institute of Technology (Japan)](http://www.kyutech.ac.jp/english). I developed a robot to assist the elderly to get them dressed up during my Ph.D.
